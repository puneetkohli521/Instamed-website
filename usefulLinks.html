<p>C. PROVISION OF THE APP</p>
<p>1. The App is designed to provide You an in-app medical Prescription sharing experience. The App</p>
<p>does not per se provide any Prescription or article or Information; but provides a platform for User</p>
<p>to share their medical Prescriptions. The App provides a summary of the medical articles/content</p>
<p>available in public domain by aggregating such content within one platform for easy access by You</p>
<p>and for assisting You to find corresponding content of health interest. When You read an article,</p>
<p>You may be linked to one of the online sources of such duly aggregated articles, upon tapping</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rdquo; tab on Your screen. You agree and acknowledge that the App does not report and/or</p>
<p>broadcast any content (including Prescriptions) on its own accord and InstaMed is not responsible</p>
<p>or liable for the content or accuracy of the articles and/or Prescriptions that may be accessed by</p>
<p>You through the App.</p>
<p>2. The App may include links to other mobile applications and/or websites which may contain</p>
<p>materials that are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support these links</p>
<p>or the products and services they provide; these links are provided for Your convenience only. We</p>
<p>are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such links. The App also includes</p>
<p>Prescriptions and Information shared by Users which may contain materials and Information that</p>
<p>are objectionable, unlawful, or inaccurate. We do not endorse or support these Prescriptions or the</p>
<p>Information they provide; these Prescriptions and Information are provided for Your convenience</p>
<p>only. We are not responsible or liable for the content or accuracy of such Prescriptions.</p>
<p>3. In order to provide the App to You, We may request You to register and/or provide Information</p>
<p>about yourself. We trust that any Information and/or Prescription provided by You will always be</p>
<p>true, accurate, complete and updated.</p>
<p>4. The content displayed on the App is for Your non-commercial and personal use. You are not</p>
<p>allowed to copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works of, or publicly display any content</p>
<p>displayed on the App.</p>
<p>5. We may stop provision of the App (or any part of the App), permanently or temporarily, to You or</p>
<p>to Users generally or may modify or change the nature of the App and/or these Terms at Our sole</p>
<p>discretion, without any prior notice to You. Your use of the App following any such modification</p>
<p>constitutes Your deemed acceptance to be bound by the Agreement (or as it may be modified).</p>
<p>D. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH INSTAMED</p>
<p>1. A violation of this Agreement may result in a legal liability upon You and that nothing in this</p>
<p>Agreement should be construed to confer any rights to any third party. You are responsible for Your</p>
<p>conduct and activities while using the App, and for any consequences thereof.</p>
<p>2. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable under the applicable law, it will</p>
<p>not affect the enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this</p>
<p>Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a</p>
<p>valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the</p>
<p>remaining provisions shall be enforced.</p>
<p>3. We may choose to not act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by You or others but this</p>
<p>does not mean that We cannot act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Our intended or</p>
<p>intended failure to exercise or enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver</p>
<p>of such right or provision.</p>
<p>E. USING THE APP</p>
